// Fix: Commented out TypeScript triple-slash directives to resolve compilation errors.
// This is a workaround for a project configuration issue where Next.js types are not found.
// The project seems to import all necessary types explicitly, so this should be safe.
// /// <reference types="next" />
// /// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript for more information.
